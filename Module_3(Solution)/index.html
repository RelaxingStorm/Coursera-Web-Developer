                    Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world,
                    and was one of the first domesticated animals. 
                    Chicken is a major worldwide source of meat and eggs for human consumption. 
                    It is prepared as food in a wide variety of ways, varying by region and culture. 
                    The prevalence of chickens is due to almost the entire chicken being edible, and the ease of raising them.
                    Chicken as a meat has been depicted in Babylonian carvings from around 600 BC.
                    Chicken was one of the most common meats available in the Middle Ages. 
                    It was eaten over most of the Eastern hemisphere and a number of different kinds of chicken such as capons, pullets and hens were eaten. 
                    It was one of the basic ingredients in the so-called white dish, a stew usually consisting of chicken and fried onions cooked in milk and seasoned with spices and sugar.
