This repo was created for a Course named as "HTML, CSS and Javascript for Web Developers" on Coursera.
USING THIS REPO MODULES IN YOUR ASSIGNMENTS IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED!!!
BUT! You can view at the source code and borrow some ideas or tag structures.
Even i had to lookup for the tag placements as it gets difficult for us as a Begineer (or even as a Professional)
to understand the child tags placement with proper Bootstrap classes. But it does not mean that
copy paste would make you better in any way so PLEASE don't copy paste the source as it is...

Reason: Some Guy recently checked my assignment and copied my link and attached it to his Assignment... can
you think how bad it feels when people literally copy your work..
So please don't be that guy who checks and then post's others work as it is lol

Stay awesome, have a good day.

Regards~
