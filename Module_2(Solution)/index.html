                    <p>HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. 
                    It was the fifth and last major version of HTML that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. 
                    The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard and is maintained by a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), 
                    the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).
                    HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications.
                    For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications, because it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind.

                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.
                    CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
                    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. 
                    This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, 
                    enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.

                    <div id="js"> JS </div>
                    <p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
                    JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. 
                    The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,
                    and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
                    As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
                    It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). 
                    However, the language itself does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.
